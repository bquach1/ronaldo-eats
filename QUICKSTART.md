## How AI Recommendations Work

### The Algorithm Learns From:
1. **Your Ratings** - Higher rated restaurants' cuisines are preferred
2. **Cuisine Patterns** - If you rate Italian high, you'll see more Italian
3. **Price Preferences** - Matches your typical spending level
4. **Distance** - Prioritizes closer restaurants
5. **Diversity** - Ensures variety in recommendations

### Example:
If you give 5 stars to:
- Italian restaurant ($$)
- Japanese restaurant ($$$)
- Italian restaurant ($$)

You'll see more:
- Italian and Japanese restaurants
- Mid to upscale price levels ($$-$$$)
- Options near your location
